												<p style="width:100%;">Islamophobia is the hatred and prejudice against islam. It is also the reason hundreds of muslims are being harassed everyday. Some people believe that muslims are terrorists while other people who know muslims personally, disagree.Some scholars say that islamophobia is a form of racism. 
													One girl was annoyed because lots of people told her that muslims do not speak up for themselves. Hearing that made her angry so later she made a seven-hundred-and-twelve page long list for every time a muslim spoke up for (his/her) self. The girl's name is Heraa Hashmi. This is the link for her list below:

												<h2>Why is islamophobia spreading?</h2>

										<article>
											<div class="content">
												<p style="width:100%;">I believe islamophobia is spreading because of people that have influence,such as social media,politicians,and terrorist groups but, these are only a few examples. There are still plenty of organizations or people who hope to spread islamophobia. Although Islamophobia spreads slowly it is still devastatingly effective.</p>

												<h2>How to stop islamophobia</h2>

												<div class="features">
												<article>
												<div class="content">
												<p>The first step in stopping islamophobia is spreading awareness. People should know what is going on in the world around them. Another thing you can is join local and national groups and take action against a threat when you see one. Help people, and let the see that islam is about peace. You should try not to be impulsive if you happen to be cornered by hatred, try to keep yourself calm. Otherwise people can use your anger against you. Finally, try to make a good reputation for muslims in your community. Let people know that muslims are not terrorists.</p>
